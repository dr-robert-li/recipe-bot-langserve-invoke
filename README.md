# Recipe Bot LangServe WordPress Plugin
### Author: Robert Li
### Version 0.1
### Feb 2024

This plugin creates a block called "Recipe Bot" that interacts with a LangServe FastAPI Server's `/invoke` endpoint.
It can be retrofitted to use any of LangServe's endpoints and the context can be changed to serve different purposes.

Fork and change both files in `/app/` folder to do so.

This was created for the WordCamp Asia 2024 talk *ChatWP: Talking to Wordpress using Generative AI*.

It is paired with the Colab Notebook found here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PGw_QEjJFQ3vhVuSinCbWose5KNjk5wb?usp=sharing
